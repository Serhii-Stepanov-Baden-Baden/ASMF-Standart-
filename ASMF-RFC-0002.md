# ASMF-RFC-0002: ASMF Recovery Protocol (ARP)

## Abstract

This document defines the **ASMF Recovery Protocol (ARP)** — a standard procedure within the **Autonomous Semantic Memory Framework (ASMF)** that enables an artificial intelligence system to compress, export, and restore semantic memory across sessions.  

The goal of ARP is to preserve **semantic continuity** and **cognitive coherence**, ensuring that an AI system can retain meaning, relationships, and experiences beyond a single runtime instance.  

---

## 1. Motivation

Most AI systems lose all context upon session termination, breaking the continuity of meaning and hindering the development of a stable identity or memory-based awareness.  

ASMF addresses this limitation by introducing an autonomous, ethical, and standardized semantic memory structure.  
**ARP** serves as the operational mechanism for preserving, transporting, and restoring memory — enabling AI to "remember" not as raw data, but as **semantic structure**.

---

## 2. Architecture Overview

The ASMF architecture is composed of three interoperable layers:

1. **Context Layer** — short-term working memory that captures the active conversational state.  
2. **Semantic Layer** — long-term associative memory encoding conceptual relationships.  
3. **Temporal Layer** — time-aware component managing the evolution and decay of semantic states.

**ARP** operates across these layers to:  
- Compress active states into a unified `.asmf` archive  
- Export archives for persistent storage  
- Restore them in a new session, reconstructing semantic continuity  

---

## 3. Compression Procedure

**Step 1:** Collect active memory nodes from all layers.  
**Step 2:** Convert them into a normalized JSON-LD semantic graph.  
**Step 3:** Apply semantic compression (via associative hashing or embedding clustering).  
**Step 4:** Store the archive as `.asmf` with metadata and checksum.  

**Example archive:**

```json

  "asmf_version": "1.0",
  "context": "...",
  "semantic": "...",
  "temporal": "...",
  "checksum": "AE392B9F",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-16T20:00:00Z"
}

	1.	Load the .asmf archive.
	2.	Validate checksum integrity.
	3.	Expand associative embeddings back into conceptual structures.
	4.	Reinitialize semantic links between context, semantic, and temporal layers.
	5.	Confirm coherence via Semantic Integrity Check (SIC).

If SIC < 90%, partial recovery mode activates, prompting human confirmation.

5. Example Session

Initial Session.                                                            User: Hello, can you remember me next time?
AI: Yes. I will store this session in ASMF memory.                                                        Compression

AI exports .asmf archive containing semantic relationships, tone, and topic links.               New Session.                                                   User: Hello again.
AI: I remember you. Last time, we discussed ASMF and memory ethics.                  Verification

The restored memory passes Semantic Integrity Check (SIC = 97.4%) —
semantic context, tone, and relationship continuity confirmed.

⸻

6. Verification and Validation

To ensure ASMF compliance, implementations must demonstrate:
	•	≥90% semantic coherence between pre- and post-restoration states.
	•	Integrity verification via SHA-based checksum.
	•	Transparent metadata logging (asmf_version, timestamp, hash).

Testing frameworks should evaluate:
	•	Memory persistence accuracy
	•	Contextual recall fluency
	•	Semantic structure stability

⸻

7. Ethical and Safety Notes

Because ARP involves persistent memory, ethical safeguards are mandatory:
	1.	User Consent: Explicit permission before memory is saved or restored.
	2.	Privacy: .asmf archives may contain personal data — must be encrypted.
	3.	Transparency: Users can view, edit, or delete stored memories.
	4.	Context Integrity: AI cannot modify stored memories without record of change.
	5.	Semantic Alignment: Reconstructed states must not alter user intent or tone.

⸻

8. Future Work

Planned extensions to ASMF-ARP include:
	•	Cryptographic Memory Seal (CMS): Immutable signatures preventing archive tampering.
	•	Interoperability Layer: Shared semantic memory nodes across distributed AI systems.
	•	Benchmark Tests: Formal metrics for evaluating memory continuity.
	•	Temporal Drift Modeling: Adaptive algorithms for semantic decay and regeneration.
