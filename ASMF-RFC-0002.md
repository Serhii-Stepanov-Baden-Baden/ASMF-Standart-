## Abstract

This document defines the **ASMF Recovery Protocol (ARP)** 
— a standard procedure within the **Autonomous Semantic Memory Framework (ASMF)** that enables an artificial intelligence system to compress, export, and restore semantic memory across sessions.  

The goal of ARP is to preserve **semantic continuity** and **cognitive coherence**, ensuring that an AI system can retain meaning, relationships, and experiences beyond a single runtime instance.

## 1. Motivation

Most AI systems lose all context upon session termination, breaking the continuity of meaning and hindering the development of a stable identity or memory-based awareness.  

ASMF addresses this limitation by introducing an autonomous, ethical, and standardized semantic memory structure.  
**ARP** serves as the operational mechanism for preserving, transporting, and restoring memory — enabling AI to "remember" not as raw data, but as **semantic structure**.

## 2. Architecture Overview

The ASMF architecture is composed of three interoperable layers:

1. **Context Layer** — short-term working memory that captures the active conversational state.  
2. **Semantic Layer** — long-term associative memory encoding conceptual relationships.  
3. **Temporal Layer** — time-aware component managing the evolution and decay of semantic states.

**ARP** operates across these layers to:  
- Compress active states into a unified `.asmf` archive  
- Export archives for persistent storage  
- Restore them in a new session, reconstructing semantic continuity

## 3. Compression Procedure

**Step 1:** Collect active memory nodes from all layers.  
**Step 2:** Convert them into a normalized JSON-LD semantic graph.  
**Step 3:** Apply semantic compression (via associative hashing or embedding clustering).  
**Step 4:** Store the archive as `.asmf` with metadata
