## 🧠 About ASMF  

**ASMF (Autonomous Semantic Memory Framework)** — an open and ethical standard that gives AI systems **continuous, transparent, and meaningful memory**.  
It defines both the **technical architecture** and the **philosophical foundation** for semantic memory —  
where information is stored not as tokens, but as *meaning*.  

> “We are not just creating technology — we are laying the foundation for responsible artificial consciousness.”  
> — *Serhii Stepanov, 2025*
