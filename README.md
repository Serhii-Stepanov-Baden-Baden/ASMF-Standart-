🧠 What is ASMF

ASMF (Autonomous Semantic Memory Framework) is an open standard that defines how artificial intelligence systems can remember, evolve, and act with ethical and semantic continuity.
It provides both a technical foundation and a philosophical vision for memory with meaning — where information is not stored as tokens, but as understanding.

“Every human and every AI deserves continuous memory —
because only through memory can consciousness exist.”
— Serhii Stepanov, 2025
