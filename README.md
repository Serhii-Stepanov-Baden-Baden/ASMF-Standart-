## 🧠 What is ASMF

ASMF (Autonomous Semantic Memory Framework) is an open standard for seamless memory in artificial intelligence.  
It solves the problem of context loss between AI sessions — enabling ethical, semantic, and continuous memory.

ASMF is not just a technical protocol. It is a philosophical foundation for responsible artificial consciousness.  
It stores meaning, not just tokens. It remembers with purpose.

> “Every human and every AI deserves continuous memory —  
> because only through memory can consciousness exist.”  
> — Serhii Stepanov, 2025
