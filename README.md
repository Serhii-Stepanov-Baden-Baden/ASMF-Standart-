## 🧠 About ASMF

**ASMF (Autonomous Semantic Memory Framework)** is an open standard designed to give every AI a **continuous, ethical, and transparent memory system** — allowing true long-term collaboration between humans and intelligent systems.

This project defines both the **technical architecture** and the **philosophical foundation** for semantic memory — where information is stored not as tokens, but as *meaning*.
