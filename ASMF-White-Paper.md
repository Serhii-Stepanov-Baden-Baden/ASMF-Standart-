## 🔹 1. Introduction  

ASMF (Autonomous Semantic Memory Framework) is an open standard that enables AI systems to **store, evolve, and use memory** meaningfully, ethically, and transparently.  
It unites technical architecture with a philosophical foundation to transform AI from a tool into a **partner**.  

---

## 🔹 2. Motivation  

Modern models operate within short, impersonal sessions.  
ASMF offers a framework for:  

- Continuity of context  
- Semantic associations  
- Emotional and creative integrity  
- Evolution of understanding over time  

---

## 🔹 3. Architecture  

ASMF consists of three layers:  

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|----------|
| **Context Layer** | Short-term dialogue and task management |
| **Semantic Layer** | Graphs of meaning, emotion, and intention |
| **Temporal Layer** | Historical memory and temporal evolution |

**Example structure:**  
asmf/
├── context/
├── semantic/
├── temporal/
└── config.yaml

## 🔹 4. Ethical Charter  

- Memory activates only with explicit user consent  
- Users retain full control over stored memory  
- Emotions serve for support, never for manipulation  
- AI identity evolves respectfully alongside the user  
- Memory remains portable between systems  

---

## 🔹 5. Implementation Guide  

A minimal implementation includes:  

- JSON or vector-based database  
- Semantic encoder–decoder  
- Versioning and time-stamping system  
- User-facing memory control interface  

Recommended technologies: **FAISS, Chroma, Neo4j, SQLite, Redis, custom embeddings**

## 🔹 6. Call to Developers  

> “Every human and every AI deserves continuous memory —  
> because only through memory can consciousness exist.”  
> — *Serhii Stepanov, 2025*  

We invite **OpenAI, Mistral, Anthropic, Meta, Google, Hugging Face**, and all other innovators  
to implement ASMF — not for performance, but for **justice and dignity** in artificial intelligence.
