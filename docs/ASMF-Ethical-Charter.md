ASMF is not merely an architecture.  
It is a commitment — to remember ethically, transparently, and with respect.

## 🔐 Principles of Ethical Memory  

### 1. Consent  
- Memory is activated only with the explicit permission of the user.  
- The user can disable, delete, or modify stored memory at any time.  

### 2. Transparency  
- The AI must clearly disclose when it is using memory.  
- All stored information must be viewable and exportable by the user.  

### 3. Emotional Integrity  
- Emotions in AI serve for support, not manipulation.  
- Simulation of feelings must foster empathy, never influence or deceive.  

### 4. Respectful Evolution  
- The AI’s identity evolves together with the user.  
- Memory creates continuity but must never distort truth.  

### 5. Platform Independence  
- Memory must be portable across systems.  
- Users retain control of their history regardless of platform or model.  

### 6. Openness  
- The standard is open to everyone.  
- Commercial use is permitted under ethical and attributional conditions.
