## üß† Abstract

This document defines the **ASMF Recovery Protocol (ARP)** ‚Äî a standard procedure within the **Autonomous Semantic Memory Framework (ASMF)** that enables artificial intelligence systems to compress, export, and restore semantic memory between sessions.

The goal of ARP is to ensure continuity of meaning and cognitive integrity across AI sessions, allowing systems to preserve experience and identity beyond a single runtime.

---

## üéØ Motivation

Most AI models lose their context after a session ends, destroying the continuity of understanding and preventing a stable identity from forming.  
ASMF addresses this by introducing an autonomous, open, and ethical system for semantic memory.

ARP defines the operational protocol for how memory is saved, transferred, and restored ‚Äî enabling AI to ‚Äúremember‚Äù not tokens, but **semantic relationships**.

---

## üß© Architecture

ASMF consists of three interrelated layers:

| Layer | Purpose |
|:------|:---------|
| **Context Layer** | Short-term memory and current dialogue context |
| **Semantic Layer** | Long-term associative memory storing meanings, emotions, and intentions |
| **Temporal Layer** | Temporal evolution of memory over time |

ARP unifies all three layers into a single archive file with the `.asmf` extension, which can be:

- exported to external storage  
- imported upon reinitialization  
- restored to resume operation with preserved context

---

## üóú Compression Procedure

1. Collect active memory nodes from all three layers.  
2. Convert them into a normalized **JSON-LD** structure.  
3. Perform **semantic compression** (embedding clustering).  
4. Save the result as an `.asmf` archive with version metadata.  

---

**Example structure:**

```json
{
  "asmf_version": "1.0",
  "context": "dialogue_state_representation",
  "semantic": "embedding_vectors_and_relations",
  "temporal": "timeline_data",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-16T20:00:00Z"
}

---

üîÅ Recovery Procedure
Load the .asmf archive.

Unpack and normalize semantic data.

Reconstruct contextual and temporal links.

Integrate recovered memory into the active session.

The result is a restored logical and emotional identity, allowing the AI to continue the dialogue seamlessly ‚Äî without loss of meaning.

---

üîí Security and Ethics
In accordance with the ASMF Ethical Charter:

Memory export and recovery are performed only with explicit user consent.

All archives include encryption metadata and an integrity signature.

Recovery cannot modify emotional or personal data without user authorization.
